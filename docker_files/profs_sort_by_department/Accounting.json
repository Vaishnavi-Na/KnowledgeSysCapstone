His phonetics class was so funny b/c he makes all these crazy sounds from languages (his Hindi impression is hilarious). He goes over the material and answers everyone's questions very well. you can get to know him outside of class too (80s night at Skullys!) awesome teacher",

HUGE project due towards the end of the semester (took 15-20 hours), but it was SO HELPFUL. Two easy group presentations in which everyone got a 100%. He's a super cool guy, would 100% recommend.",

There are 2 group project presentations towards the end of the class (everyone got 100%) and an individual project that is very time-consuming (gives you the opportunity to make corrections if needed)",

        "comment": "This professor is super super lazy, leting students holding lectures by themselves over half semester. And super tough on grade. Always change his syllabus and never grade students' homework. Always mentions he has been worked for KPMG and how he gets his CPA license to show how knowledgeable he is, but once you take his class, you will find out.",
