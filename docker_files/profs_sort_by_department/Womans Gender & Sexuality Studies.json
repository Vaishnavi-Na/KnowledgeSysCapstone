While she is a harsh grader on papers, and never gave me feedback although I asked for it multiple times, there are only 4 assignments in the whole class. Tons of readings though. Hannah is a very kind person though and if you're a good writer you will get an easy A. She also cancels class like once a week. ",

Overall the class is very easy if you want a GE where you don't have to do too much work. But as far as I can tell, she is just assigning readings and quizzes and can't even do that on time.
