We were instructed to get a new edition of the text book which was very expensive and was a total waste. She never referred to the new edition and all her notes had figures from the old text. Not a good teacher!!!",

Memorized 500+ slides for each exam, but all info was irrelevant (half of test was interpreting data). Got a B+ in class w/ curve after having a 98% because avg was a 52% on the final.",

Going to lecture is almost pointless, besides when he offers extra credit. Tests are ridiculously confusing and tough. Avoid this guy at all costs!",

He tries to make the class difficult by giving vague directions to his assignments.  Average on midterm was 66...so  he blamed us for being bad students.  Thanks Abdul, you made me hate evolution.",
