He was hesitant to accept my SLDS accomodations though at the beginning of the year and I never got them implemented. (I ended up not needing them for this course since it was so flexible).",

There are a few assignments, tests, and discussions, but they are all easy to complete. Also, the course is over halfway through the semester making it even easy and helpful.",

Since this was a survey course and attendance was mandatory, the lectures could get pretty boring because there was not a lot of content to lecture about. Only a few assignments in this course so if you apply yourself its an easy pass.",
