My classmate Mike Oxhard and I studied very long and very hard for this course. After taking this course, I have learned the fundamentals that FLG234 was supposed to teach. Have fun!",

I hear a statue will be erected of his likeness made of hard wood. Lectures are a little dry, so they can be rough sometimes.",

He taught the Gurgling 101 class and was an inspiration to all with his complete control of the language--also a master of rhino mating calls. Generally needs to improve hygiene and English language skills. Best professor I've ever had. Downside is class is at midnight.",
