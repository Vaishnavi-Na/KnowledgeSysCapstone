However, if you're just getting a GE out of the way, it's an alright class.",

He was a tough grader which made every assignment a little scary because there were very few, but make sure you put in the time and effort and youll be fine. The course was interesting and he did his best to conduct participatory discussions rather than talk at us.",

He was so unaccommodating when he assigned an assignment that required me to interact with a child because of the ongoing pandemic. He also assigned an online group project worth 7 points which was a nightmare since 2 of my group members rarely communicated with the rest of the group",

You will read one YA book a week, and discuss in small groups, but its really not too bad as his book choices are great! He is also always able to help and answer questions if need be. Overall a great professor!",
