Quizzes arent really quizzes but rather, what are your thoughts on this.. questions. I have his 3 hours class and it doesnt even feel that long bc the material is engaging so class time flies by.",

He connects well with the students, and tries to learn about each one personally, showing just how much he cares for you, your well being, and how you're doing in his class.",

There is a lot of reading, and a discussion post for each week of readings. Overall, despite being overwhelmed at times, she was caring and always willing to help her students!",

Dr. E made the class atmosphere conducive to learning and discussing issues of ethnicity in terms of contemporary art theory. i don't advise taking this class if you aren't up for writing. there are many assignments but they are manageable and def. build your writing skills. overall a great class and instructor.",
