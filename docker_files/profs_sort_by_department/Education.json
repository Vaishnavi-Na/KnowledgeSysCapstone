I took this as my literature GE, and it was nice we mostly read picture books and a couple elementary chapter books. You have to present on a book, but you get to choose out of a list. Overall very fun course I would recommend",

On the third week, we asked him questions & got answers we needed. He is very nice & understanding, but needs to be more organized.  The class is very dry, repetitive, & almost 3 hours long. Very nice guy though.",
