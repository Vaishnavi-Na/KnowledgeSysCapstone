She does a good job getting the content across to students, but I definitely encourage taking advantage of her extra review problems she posts along and asking plenty of questions. Genetics is a difficult topic to grasp, but Dr. Petreaca was able to facilitate a well organized online class regardless!",

She replies back to emails fairly quickly and will answer all of your questions.",

Her exams are fairly difficult but she does take that in to account and curves a decent amount. I wish every professor could be like her. 12/10 great prof",
