The tests at least covered the material we went over in class. She dives deep into the material and lectures on things not covered in the test. Most people were getting between 60%-70% on all but one test. ",

The class has quizzes on readings, packback, mastering, and tophat. The exams were horrible. Overall, this class was too difficult for a nonmajors molecular genetics class.",

Lectures are so boring and so much material is presented at once. There are only diagrams on the slides which are not helpful because no explanations. Class is frustrated and she just smiles when we are struggling.",

She does a good job getting the content across to students, but I definitely encourage taking advantage of her extra review problems she posts along and asking plenty of questions. Genetics is a difficult topic to grasp, but Dr. Petreaca was able to facilitate a well organized online class regardless!",

She gives 2 bonus points per quiz and exam reflection if you go to her office hours. She drops your lowest exam and replaces it with your average exam grades. She replies back to emails fairly quickly and will answer all of your questions.",

Her exams are fairly difficult but she does take that in to account and curves a decent amount. I wish every professor could be like her. 12/10 great prof",
