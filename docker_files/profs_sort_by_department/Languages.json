If you notice that you are having trouble in the first few days then drop the course or talk with the professor but if you can put in the time and effort, then keep at it.",

She is very passionate about teaching French so it makes it a lot easier to learn, and as long as you put in some effort you should do fine. Of all French classes, I've definitely learned the most from her class. If you have the option to take one of her classes, I would 100% recommend her.",

He picks poor material to cover, doesnt explain it well, then gives 5 quizzes &amp; a cumulative final on it. Design &amp; written tests do not mix; the actual Design Dept. forgoes them altogether.

Just memorize what you are supposed to (takes like 10 minutes a night) and you'll be fine.",

While some find the class boring and unengaging, many students still manage to earn high grades through minimal effort and utilizing provided study materials.",
