However, she didn't put in any grades in Carmen for the entire semester, and it turns out that the take-home final was basically 100% of our grade, which freaked everyone out. I got an A, but Im hesitant to call it an easy A, because I'm a good writer and I don't know how others did. The class is super chill though",
