I think I listened to her teach on Zoom for maybe 5 hours over the whole semester so this class is very self-driven but extremely doable with office hours and the internet. If its your first coding class give yourself a HUGE advantage and practice with a free online java website before!",

Lectures are not mandatory but you do sign in so she knows who came and who didn't at the end of the semester when people want their final grade bumped up.
