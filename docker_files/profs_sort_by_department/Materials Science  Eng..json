        "comment": "Dr. Grassman's lectures are clear and you can learn a lot from him about renewable energy and photovoltaics. However, his lectures can be dry and he grades harshly because he wants you to write great proposals. There is no homework for this class which means you need to put a lot of time into the papers to do well. Good class but it isn't easy.",
