However, his lectures can be dry and he grades harshly because he wants you to write great proposals. There is no homework for this class which means you need to put a lot of time into the papers to do well. Good class but it isn't easy.",

Definitely talk to him outside of class if you don't get everything in lecture. He explains better one-on-one.  Pop quizzes at least once a week usually over his summary slides. Tests not hard at all as long as you study. Very fair.",
