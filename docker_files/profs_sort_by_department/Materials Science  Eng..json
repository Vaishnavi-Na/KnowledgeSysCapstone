However, his classes are considered challenging due to his dry lecture style and strict grading on proposal quality, necessitating substantial effort outside of class. Despite its difficulties, the class is deemed valuable.",

However, his lectures can be dry and he grades harshly because he wants you to write great proposals. There is no homework for this class which means you need to put a lot of time into the papers to do well. Good class but it isn't easy.",
