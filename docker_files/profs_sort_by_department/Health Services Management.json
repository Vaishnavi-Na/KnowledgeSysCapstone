Dr. Robinson and her course truly changed my perception of health and medicine and left a lasting impact on my career. It's very obvious she care very deeply about the course and knows a lot about the material. I learned so much from her.",

Her slides almost never match the one she gives us because they're out of order. There's a lot of reading and writing for this class. If possible, avoid her.",

I absolutely love Dr. Robinson - she is a lot of fun. She isn't super &quot;type A,&quot; so some people who type-A personalities may have other opinions, but I've always enjoyed her courses!",
