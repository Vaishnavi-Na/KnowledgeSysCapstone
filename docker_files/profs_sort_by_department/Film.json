There are weekly papers (2 pgs) and quizzes (15 Qs,mult. ch.) but it's VERY easy to get 100%s on all of them.  The course paper (not a research paper) is also easy, 6 pages, i wrote it in 2 hours. You just have to study for his essay midterm and final.",

That being said, he was more than happy to explain things if asked. TA graded exams (which are all essay) & randomly marked off points without explanation. Would not recommend as a GE class. ",
