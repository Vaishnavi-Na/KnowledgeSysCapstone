She is extremely engaging during lessons, provides extra information to make lessons more interesting, and it is clear she has a passion for teaching and helping students. There are a few assignments each unit, but they are very manageable. Only thing to note is that attendance is important to her and your success!",

My only qualms was a) the expressive tests are done sitting in front of her which just does not make for the most natural comfortable environment...potentially explaining mistakes. and b) her attendance is very very strict. Miss a few classes and your grade will be heavily affected",

She cares about all of her students a great deal and teaches sign language in such a respectful way for a teacher that is not deaf herself. ",
