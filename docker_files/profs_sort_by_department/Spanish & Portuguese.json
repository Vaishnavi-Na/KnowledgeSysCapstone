I would recommend her to every one because she helped me understand despite signing up for the course last minute.",

Exams are just like practice exams so make to do those. Also, there is weekly homeworks which force you to read the text book, and that's actually a grade booster if you try on those.",

From all of the Spanish classes I have taken so far, I have learned the most from this one thanks to Ashlee. She was always willing to help and it is beyond obvious how dedicated and motivated she is to teaching .",

It is not an easy class as you analyze more advanced Spanish, but she is awesome, and also super helpful during office hours. She's a student too, so she understands what's going on.",

She likes to remind the class that she was once/still is a student and she doesn't want to make things too difficult for us in class, but she will challenge you and you will get out of the class what you put in. She is very willing to work with you, but you need to express your want for help!",

She occasionally calls on people randomly but this is usually only is when people don't talk in class. She often goes around the room and makes everyone talk but that is to be expected.",
