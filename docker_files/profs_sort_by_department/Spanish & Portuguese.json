Exams are just like practice exams so make to do those. Also, there is weekly homeworks which force you to read the text book, and that's actually a grade booster if you try on those.",

She likes to remind the class that she was once/still is a student and she doesn't want to make things too difficult for us in class, but she will challenge you and you will get out of the class what you put in. She is very willing to work with you, but you need to express your want for help!",
