Did not have enough midterms for everyone the first time so the actual one was tough.  KNOW EVERYTHING INSIDE AND OUT!!",

Also they did not have enough copies made for the second midterm.  Half the class short, unbelieveable.  She sucks!!!!",

Our TA was totally inept,not to mention that the 2nd midterm exam was postponed because of their incompetence to assure that there were enough exams to go around; the retake was even more difficult because we &quot;had more time to study for it&quot;, verified by the TAs. What BS.",
