You might get a paper here and there. You dont even have to read the novels just make sure you say something to get a participation grade. Thats it, it is a easy class",

Our class focused too heavily on diversity and our class had no idea about anything that was being taught in the other survey courses like contacting advisors, application to major, etc. I'm just glad we didn't have to attend class after 7 weeks, as our time was wasted in there",

If you want an easy A and GE credit, take this class with her. If you want a truly robust analysis of history that requires deep thought, don't bother.",
