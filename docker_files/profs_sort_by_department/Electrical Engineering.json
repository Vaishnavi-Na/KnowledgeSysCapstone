Will cover questions during office hours or class. Be prepared to be called on to answer in class. Tests are very reasonable (one page of notes), graded fairly. Overall would highly recommend him.",

If you want to learn something useful, he is the best option.",

Homeworks aren't graded, but there are single-question quizzes based on the homework, so you still need to do it. Homeworks are harder than exams; if you understand the lecture material and practice exam, that is enough.",

I understand that technical writing/communication is important and she wants the class to be 2 credit hours, but it was too much research and writing for 1 credit hour. Not a tough grader, though.",

Class is a reasonable amount of work, but expect to learn the material from more of a birds-eye view (i.e., Dr. Z's way of teaching is more 'get the general gist of what's going on' rather than 'know every small detail about circuits' - which IMO was beneficial.

But, he ups the difficulty on the midterms and final. He's got an all-or-nothing policy on questions. He only uploads partial slides online, and uses pop quizzes to coax kids to come to class.",
