The worst part is I think i would have enjoyed the content if presented differently. She doesn't really teach you, just makes you talk to each other about the abundant readings you had to do.",

Verbally aggressive. Talks down to you. Not to mention, the class was very boring, super-wordy and technical. Lots of reading, you have to read in HEAVY detail to be able to pass.",

For the first several weeks you will have the reading assignment, just read them and make some mark, then you can get A. Be careful not to plagiarize! That's the target of this course. Overall, she is pretty good, caring and respectful.",

The course includes a single final exam with straightforward questions, and the instructor is known for being a fair grader. While attendance is required and deducts points per missed class, students find the material engaging and the professor to be very approachable.",
