His exams are a large part of the grade but he makes sure you are prepared for them. The other assignments were actually enjoyable because it was either a movie or book. Would definitely recommend."

I found professor goldish to be hilarious & extremely knowledgeable. This isn't an easy A but you learn a lot and it will change your perspective on a lot of different world issues. 10/10 would recommend."

The discussion posts only required a decent amount of effort because you needed to complete the weekly readings to answer the discussion posts. Only 2 papers for the class but he grades fair. ",

You write your own notes and go over them in class, it helps you learn a lot more. She is very knowledgeable and helpful and I learned a lot in her class. There is a lot of work but nothing hard and it was worth it!",

Did not learn any history at all. Very disappointed. Have to write a paper every week and her lectures were about how to use citations every week, not history.",

She expects all of us to see her in office hours, even if you have an A in the class. She threatens to lower your grade if you do not attend the office hours to talk about your papers. I will NEVER take her again. Shes full of herself.",

She has essays during the quarter, 7 pop quizzes (2 dropped), you're allowed to miss 2 classes, her lectures are taught well and the book is a re-enforcer to the material. There are 5 debates, but they're really easy. She's helpful if you ask. I'm a student that normally gets a/b grades and she wasn't hard at all, just do the work",
