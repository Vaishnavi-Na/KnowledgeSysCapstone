Assignments were very cut-and-dry and had specific instructions, which made it easy to complete. Some extra credit provided. I actually finished with higher than 100% in the course. Great teacher!",

However, some find the class demanding and criticize the frequent quizzes without much feedback, as well as the midterm exam format. Overall, while many recommend her class, it comes with significant workload and potential challenges.",
