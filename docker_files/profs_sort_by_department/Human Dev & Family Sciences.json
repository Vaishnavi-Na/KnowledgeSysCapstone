Jen's passion and enthusiasm for human development is obvious from the second you walk into her class. She always has a huge smile on her face and is just a wonderful person to learn from and work with",

You have to do 5 papers for participation in class, really short and opinion based, but if you do more, you get extra credit (so attend class). No online notes, so its imp to be in class, which really helps on exams- which are basically open note (cheat sheet allowed).",

In class, I was never bored because she encourages very casual participation and lots of discussion which is interesting because my class was very diverse. We never knew what stories we were about to hear and I laughed during every lecture.",

Attendance isn't mandatory but she gives 6 &quot;5-minute papers&quot; at random times throughout the semester. If you go to lecture you definitely don't need the book. Plus you get a full page of notes on every exam!! I highly recommend this class",

She works hard to make sure that myself and the other assistants know what we are doing and how the research process works, and genuinely cares about our well-being outside of the lab. I definitely recommend taking a class with her!",
