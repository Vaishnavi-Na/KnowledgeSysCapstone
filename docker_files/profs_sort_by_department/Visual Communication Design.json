Requires proof of absence (doctor's note or obituary like we're in grade school) \nSame lecture repeated throughout term, didn't learn actual typography practice, EMPLOYERS say they don't care to see projects from this class. waste of time and money.",

Repeated same lecture probably ten times instead of giving individual feedback, forcing people to stay after class. Critiques our work, then goes back on it after we make changes. Really creepy towards girls and lacks personal space / boundaries / general respect. ",
