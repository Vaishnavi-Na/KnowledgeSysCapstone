Requires proof of absence (doctor's note or obituary like we're in grade school) \nSame lecture repeated throughout term, didn't learn actual typography practice, EMPLOYERS say they don't care to see projects from this class. waste of time and money.",

Repeated same lecture probably ten times instead of giving individual feedback, forcing people to stay after class. Critiques our work, then goes back on it after we make changes. Really creepy towards girls and lacks personal space / boundaries / general respect. ",

Assignments given are abstract and experimental, benefiting our future careers in design in no way. Spends an hour or two talking about nonsense so, he demands after-class meetings, claiming they're optional, but they're crucial for a good grade.\n",

Hes literally like a sensei in a karate movie that the kid hates at first because of the harsh work the senseis making him do, but then realizes how lucky he is be under his wing.",

I would not be the designer I am now without Keith. He knows how to critique in an extremely productive manner for the learner. His aesthetic for design is exceptional.",
