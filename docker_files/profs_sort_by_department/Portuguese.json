She gives us last minute homework assignments and brings up random topics she's never covered in class before. She's a little rude too telling the class that ALMOST everyone speaks good Spanish. That is so rude to say to a class of students learning a new language. ",

It is never clear what she wants from the students and no one ever knew what to do for homework. Genuinely lost my ability to speak Spanish over the course of a semester with her. If you get her as a teacher, do yourself a favor, and get out.",

She doesn't follow the syllabus, changes grade requirements constantly and emails hw assignments that take hours at 9pm the day before a 9:30am class. Would never take a class with her again.",

She gives 10 MC questions worth 50% of each test grade and 2 short essays for the other 50%.  She assigns questions on a boring book and then she talks about the most random stuff in class. The grading is easy, but she's crazy.",
