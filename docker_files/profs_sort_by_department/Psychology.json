The book is not needed but go to lecture because he tells you a lot of information.  His lectures are VERY entertaining.",

However, his availability outside of class is limited, and some students find his tests particularly difficult due to their complexity.",

Exams are straightforward and based heavily on class content, making them relatively easy to prepare for with minimal effort. While the professor is generally well-liked and approachable, some students note that attending class is crucial for success due to pop quizzes and the need to stay current with notes.",

He tries to make class fun, but the material isn't very interesting. Exams are all m/c, t/f, matching and very easy, as long as you put in a little time to review (the notes pile up.) Don't need the textbook at all.",
