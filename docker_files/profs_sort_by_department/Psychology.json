There are 3 ten ten-question quizzes which normally take less than 20 minutes to do, 3 reflections that are super easy and make up like 25% of your grade, and 5 attendances which are also 25%. Just show up and you should be okay, I barely studied, just know your terms. Offered so much EC!",

Understanding R Studio is crucial to doing well in this class, so this is not one you want to skip! Most of the exams were online with 2 attempts, and he offers an abundant amount of extra credit. His dry humor was also pretty funny.",
