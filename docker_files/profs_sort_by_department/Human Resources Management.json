Aced all exams but the final (no cumulative) was pretty hard.  You can probably skip class and still get an A if you read the book and be sure to print off his post lecture slides",

His exams are extremelyyy hard and from the book. He expects you to read lvl 800 stuff for a simple course. He ruined my grade. I regret taking him. spare yourself...He sux!!!!",
