If you are a non certain student, you will struggle to keep up as cert students spend hours a day in lab learning the stuff more, getting ahead. 18/25 failed a midterm this quarter, and she just talked about how she wouldn't lower her standards... Maybe the test was too hard dr Waller? Come on! BTW NO CURVE!!! Nice lady though.",
