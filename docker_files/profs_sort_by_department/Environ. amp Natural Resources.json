        "comment": "Talks very fast and lectures are scattered all over the place so it's hard to piece information together. Exams aren't hard, but she is not an easy grader. The first excel homework took me well over 14 hours combined so be very proactive on starting them as soon as they are posted. Lots of homework near exams. Meet with the TA as much as possible.",
