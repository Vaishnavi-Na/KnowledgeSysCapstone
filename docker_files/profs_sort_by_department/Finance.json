He gave us 2 pop quizzes (on carmen, but he told us about them in lecture and you had the whole weekend to complete them) for 10 points each, while the three homework assignments were 100 points each!! Lowest exam grade dropped. Highly recommend.",

The only problem I had was the inability to review your past quizzes. You never know what you got right or wrong and it is hard to correct your mistakes for the cumulative final quiz",

The software used to monitor cheating, Proctorio, is a pain. I reccomend taking detailed notes over the videos and do the optional practice files and save them, as they often show up on quizzes. Wish hed post solutions.",

Since he is very smart, he uses complex technical jargon and I think he forgets that he needs to dumb things down for students; so, his lectures are hard to understand. He is hysterical though, and a great person overall.",

The class (also taught by Susan, another great instructor) followed a basic format: 1) Watch lecture videos 2) go to lecture, 3)do recitation problems  4) go to recitation 5) if you struggle do the book practice problems. Class was easy if you care. Conceptual and it builds on itself",
