While this was by no means an &quot;easy A&quot; course, he prepares you well for exams so as long as you put in the work you will do well! This is a pretty reading heavy course but many of the readings are interesting and tests are primarily based off your opinion of them.",

It is a general pharmacology course covering almost 30 chapters of Lippincott's Pharmacology 3rd edition.  It is a completely userfriendly online course.  I highly recommend the course for any Pre-Health Professional Major.",
