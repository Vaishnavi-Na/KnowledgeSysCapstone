Her tests are very specific so definitely read her slides if you want to do well on exams. I love the fact she gave extra credit which boosted my grade by one letter grade. Don't purchase the book. Everything is covered in the slides.",

However, Emily has said she will be reforming this portion, so you may be in luck. She's a nice woman-- eager to help and provides loads of extra credit. Boring though; good luck staying awake!",
