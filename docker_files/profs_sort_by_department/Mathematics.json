However, he does try to \"dumb down\" differential equations for the class, which helps a lot. His exams are fair, with some being pretty easy and others being pretty challenging. Overall, he is a good professor and you should do fine in the class",

If you participate in class, whether right or wrong, you get credit for it. He is always available on zoom if you need help. Go to class, pay attention, ask questions, you will get an A.

    "summary_comment": "Professor Taylor provides clear lectures that effectively prepare students for exams and homework, with content closely aligned between the two. Her classes, particularly in linear algebra, are challenging but rewarding, moving quickly and requiring effort, especially for those new to proof-based mathematics. While she occasionally ignores the OSU academic calendar, her accessibility outside of class and willingness to address student questions via email make her a strong instructor.",
    "summary_comment_short": "Professor Taylor's lectures were clear and effectively prepared students for exams and homework, though her responsiveness to emails was inconsistent for an online class. She excelled in teaching linear algebra, providing thorough explanations and addressing common student questions, but did not adhere to the university's break schedule for assignments.",

Grades are based on how many outcomes you master, but you have to hit every single point of each outcome perfectly to receive a DFU. The only way to get DFU is on hw or exam but they dont even grade all of your work. Class is all group work and no teaching.",

If youre on the fence of taking 1172 or 2162 take the latter. She focuses class around discussion ideas instead of just computations. Tests are hard but homework and quizzes are weighted a good amount too so it distributes.",

Always responds to emails quickly, has super helpful office hours (these are key if you're struggling), allows personal cheat sheets, and gives fair exams. Make sure you do well on all homework as there aren't many grades, but his class is worth it. 100% recommend",

Lectures consist primarily of the professor reading from the textbook, and office hours are infrequent and unhelpful.

Lectures can be dry and largely consist of slide readings, though in-person sessions are recommended for better understanding.

Some students found her tests easy and grading fair, though tests were longer than expected, and she could get upset if students couldn't finish them. Others criticized her for not adequately covering key concepts, organizing the class in a way that promotes rote memorization rather than understanding, and providing minimal support outside of class. Overall, opinions are divided, with some recommending her despite her challenges.",

However, his classroom demeanor can be confusing, with frequent joking that sometimes comes across as harsh rather than humorous. While his tests are challenging, they are manageable for students who are well-prepared.",

He would often joke, which was sometimes funny but often just came across as harsh. It was hard to tell if he liked us or really hated us. Tests were also extremely difficult.",

Also, the tests the department chose really weren't that difficult as long as you know what you're doing. He does have a slight accent but its not hard to understand him. I definitely recommend him as a teacher!",
