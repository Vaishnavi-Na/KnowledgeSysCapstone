Missing in-class assignments brought my grade down from an A to B+ but the material was easy enough that I didn't need lecture or the book to understand it, the slides alone were enough. Labs were easy. Final project is fun as you get to make your own map on GIS, but Dr. Xiao grades this pretty tough.",
