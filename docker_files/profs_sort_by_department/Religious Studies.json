The course is set up nice with the fact that there are weekly exams instead of midterms and finals, but the material is a lot to learn every week. Also, the \"lectures\" are just a review of the pre-recorded lectures from other professors that he makes us watch, instead of teaching us the material himself.",

        "comment": "Spencer is easily my favorite professor I have had at OSU. He is definitely picky with his grading, but his lectures are always extremely helpful, and he is easy to access outside of class. The class itself is based off of 4 papers, and since he is a picky grader, they can be intimidating, but the class is so interesting and definitely worth taking",

In order to do well in this class you will have to read, in my section we read about 5 novels and wrote 4 essays. Only graded by these essays and discussion board posts.",

Learned a lot you wouldn't normally learn in this type of intro class. Confusing in class, but great convos in office hours. Easy grading, pretty lax with it too. Discussion boards, one quiz, and a hefty research project for grades.",

Never answers questions helpfully, just goes off on tangents. Grading was confusing, couple tests and a project. The way he built the class was great though. Not your average comparative religion class--I learned a lot.",
