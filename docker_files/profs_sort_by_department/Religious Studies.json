The course is set up nice with the fact that there are weekly exams instead of midterms and finals, but the material is a lot to learn every week. Also, the \"lectures\" are just a review of the pre-recorded lectures from other professors that he makes us watch, instead of teaching us the material himself.",

Learned a lot you wouldn't normally learn in this type of intro class. Confusing in class, but great convos in office hours. Easy grading, pretty lax with it too. Discussion boards, one quiz, and a hefty research project for grades.",
