He jokes about how he ignores students in class and when he is available for office hours he berates students for the questions asked. Exams are hard because of his grading.

        "comment": "This professor is one of the worst I have ever had. He is a nice guy but, most lectures he spent the whole time just reading off the power points and trying to pronounce the words because he can't. He gave a bunch of quizzes at the end of every other lecture and barely gave you enough time to take them. Be ready to learn and read on your own.",
