Class wasn't hard per se, but focuses more on content than grammar in your writing which makes you put a little more focus on your work. I learned a TON, rather than just memorizing information.",

I thought the biweekly participation seemed unnecessary when we also had to respond to the readings separately. Krista does seem to care about the success of her students and will work with you to help.",

Bi-weekly participation is tough, but did actually help me learn. There is a LOT of writing and reading, but it did all combine to make sense. I learned a lot, but had to really work for it",

Show up, pay attention, and youll pass. Homework was also short and do-able. I highly recommend him. However, if you are politically conservative, I recommend taking a different class for your credit.",

He is an easy grader and gives help on pop quizzes with open notes! Just come to class and you'll be fine! The readings are all good readings and I was really inspired by this class.",

Way too much reading each week (30-60 pgs of thesaurus vomit) and you have to tell her what she's looking for, you don't get an opinion. Can get an A or B if you put in the time/effort. I wouldn't wish this class/prof on my worst enemy.",
