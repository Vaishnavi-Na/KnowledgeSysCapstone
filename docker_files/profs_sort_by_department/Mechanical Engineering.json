Her lectures were rather boring, though using the \"flipped classroom\" style of teaching, made class (sometimes) a recitation, which is when the class shines. Weekly quizzes were fine; don't make silly mistakes, as they will cost you dearly. The projects are good and very fair. Fine class all around.",

Not only does she truly care about every student in the class, but she makes a difficult subject such as dynamics ridiculously easy to understand. I struggled to grasp dynamics before I took her class. Her notes are excellent, and the quizzes/hw are fair.",

She structured her class in a way where you view lecture videos outside of class and then do practice problems during the regular lecture time. This, along with the homework, made it feel impossible to not know the content well by the weekly quizzes. She is now one of my favorite profs.",
