For Marketing Projects 4204, you only have group meetings with him for 25 minutes per week, the rest is on the group to prepare to deliver their project at the end of the semester. He encourages coming to his office and is quick to reply to emails.",

He has high expectations which make it hard to get a perfect score, but provides great feedback. He will go out of his way to help any of his students if you meet with him! Bad Group  Bad Grade, unless you tear apart your group in the evaluation.",

He was very unorganized for his classes and constantly behind on grading. His grading also was very opinion based and he believed a 100% isn't possible. Do not take him.",

If you are a part of a group where procrastination is a common theme, you will have a difficult time doing well on the projects.  I was disappointed.",

Other than that, he provides an environment where you really feel like you're learning rather than being talked down to.  He's got a decent sense of humor and kept the course fun & challenging.",

BUT, his midterm and final are a massive chunk of your grade and pretty difficult. He really wants you to understand the material, not just memorize terms. On the plus side, if you do marketing surveys, you'll get 5% extra credit.",

Do not take this professor if you care at all about your GPA or learning experience. You will not learn anything about marketing besides the common sense that can be learning in econ.
