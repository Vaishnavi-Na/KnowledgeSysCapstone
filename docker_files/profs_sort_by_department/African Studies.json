Another issue is that the quiz questions are vague which makes it hard to know the correct answer, BUT he gives you 45 minutes for ten questions. I honestly have not retained very much of the lectures and I am a 4.0 student.",

The questions on his quizzes were often very vague with multiple correct answers or sometimes flat out incorrect, which led to a lot of anxiety when taking the weekly quizzes.
