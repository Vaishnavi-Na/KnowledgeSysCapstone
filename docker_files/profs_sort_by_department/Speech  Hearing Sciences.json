Grades are largely based on tests (but not totally) which can be tough for some people, but she allowed us to use our notes on all the exams. So, if you pay attention and take notes in class you will do just fine!",

She actually wants the students in her class to do well and get A's on the Exams. 75% of your grade are exams and 25% is a project but if you go to class, get notes, study, and put in effort you'll get an A. Many guest speakers come in which is an amazing experience.",

The material in this course can be difficult but it is extremely apparent that she wants to do whatever she can to help the class learn it, she takes lots of questions and won't move on until we understand. The tests are fair and straightforward. You NEED to go to lecture and you will do well.",
