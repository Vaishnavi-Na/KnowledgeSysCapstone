Tests are a little odd, though you get a cheat sheet, there's bound to be a few new questions never seen before that catch you off guard and you don't know the answer, and the tests are only out of 20 pts, so if you miss 3 pts, you're automatically in the B range.

He will often show shortcuts that doesn't make sense to us yet. I felt because there was such little grounding, this style left me forgetting most of what he did shortly after but it's ok if you like signals",
