Don't take this if you aren't interested in PoliSci, but if you are you should find this relatively easy."

Once you get the hang of it you'll be completely fine and if you put in the work you'll get an A. Kevin is a great guy and the class is interesting but I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you have to for the Canadian Parliament internship.",

He's also super helpful when needed and answers emails quickly. Overall, I really enjoyed class with him!",

Model Parliaments were unique. Would definitely recommend taking a class with him. Snarky and funny guy as well.",

Really nice teacher, class wasn't very interesting at first but got a lot better as it was applied to int. policy. Responds fast. Grading rubric is very unclear and you don't really know what she's looking for so hope she likes your style",
