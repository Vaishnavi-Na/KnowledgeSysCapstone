While some students find the class manageable with diligent study and engagement, others describe it as difficult and criticize her teaching methods and exam structure.

While some students appreciate his relaxed approach and the extra credit opportunities (like bringing autographed items), others criticize his frequent intoxication during classes, which affects his ability to help students effectively. Despite the mixed reviews, many students find his passion for the subject matter and commitment to their learning experience highly valuable.",

He presents a lot of hands on demonstrations like showing us how to properly fall asleep wherever after a night of going out. He also showed us how to properly apply pomade to a faded comb over. Furthermore, Professor BD took us on a class field trip to Ugly Tuna. HES SO COOL!!!!",

So he gives everyone an A. So don't feel so special if you pass. Helpfulness was poor due to the fact that he was never sober.",
