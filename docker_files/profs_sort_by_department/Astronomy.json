A good bit of our final grade came from group work and cooperative labs. Midterms and finals were straightforward (followed material and reviews). Overall 10/10. He is super nice and caring!",

He posts the lecture slides online, but most people still come to class because he is that good. The only downside I would say is that you have to do really well on the midterms and final because there arent a lot of assignments to get points on.",

He told great stories about the people who defined modern astronomy. He had a skill for explaining difficult concepts, like the dual wave/particle nature of light, in a manner that non-scientists could comprehend. Best.",

Literally made astronomy come alive. Scholarly, yet at the same time engaging and approachable. Not a hint of condescension shown to humanities majors. If only more professors had his gifts!",
