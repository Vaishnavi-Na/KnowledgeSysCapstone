Some find her classes overwhelming, with excessive video content and resources, while others appreciate her availability and willingness to help, especially during difficult exams. The workload is generally heavy, focusing on memorization and frequent assignments, but success is achievable with consistent effort and engagement.",

I think he really needs these the most because he gets way too ADHD to stay on topic. not that that is a bad thing because it's usually entertaining. That being said, he's a good professor.",

If you take good notes, take advantage of his extra credit oppurtunities (like with the nutrition analysis assigned), and study a bit, you shouldn't need to read even for the quizzes, to get an A.",

He tells a lot of stories which are nothing to do with the class.  They may be entertaining IF I hadn't already worked all day.  The content itself is not that difficult.  He does give extra credit and bonuses.",
