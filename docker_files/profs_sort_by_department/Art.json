    "summary_comment": "Professor Thorne is known for his deep passion for photography and art, often engaging students in meaningful discussions but sometimes struggling with clarity and pacing in his lectures. While many students appreciate his honesty and useful critiques, they also find his teaching style distant and occasionally difficult to engage with, leading to challenges in receiving personalized guidance and explanations for their grades.",
    "summary_comment_short": "Professor Thorne is highly regarded for his deep knowledge and passion for photography, particularly in fostering a love for film and darkroom processes. However, his teaching style can be challenging, characterized by long, sometimes rambling lectures and a focus on practical work over theoretical instruction, leading to mixed reviews regarding his accessibility and the clarity of his feedback.",

He was helpful to bounce ideas off of and to help fine tune in the dark room but he has a small tendency to nitpick non-technical aspects in projects. He also takes forever to get grades (and contact sheets) back to you.",

He grades hard, but only with certain students, and often times, he just slaps a letter onto your final gradebook and doesn't give you any explanation as to why you got that grade. Be very wary with him & watch your back.",

The biggest advice for this class is to work hard, be patient, and always have questions. Critique is one of the foundations of art classes and unlike other class settings you are the one in control of the dialogue. Utilize the darkroom to the fullest",

While some students found the class manageable with sufficient effort, many criticized her teaching style as unwelcoming and pretentious, with a focus on rote learning rather than conceptual understanding. The online format was particularly challenging, with issues related to teamwork and time management, and several students described her as difficult and potentially offensive.",

The Zoom meetings could have been cut down, they were two hours long and if you weren't listening you wouldn't miss anything. Personally the &quot;project check-ups&quot; irritated me, but not turning in the &quot;checkpoint&quot; homework had very little effect on my grade; he is a lax grader!",
