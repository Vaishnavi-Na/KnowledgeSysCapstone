The class structure is perceived as poorly organized and potentially intimidating, with a focus on quiz performance over deep learning. Students find the material rushed and the quizzes difficult to prepare for effectively, though there are opportunities for extra credit.",

Ask a question that is not exactly on the slide, and be prepared for a \"Ill get back to you on that\". Honestly, the material inst bad at all. The way its presented is a nightmare. ",

Just rewatch the lecture videos, everything she will ask is based on what she taught. Emphasize on materials properties most of the time",

On multiple occasions she taught information that was incorrect according to the textbook.  She is very knowledgable in her speciality however when it comes to general material science she is clueless.  Avoid at all costs.",
