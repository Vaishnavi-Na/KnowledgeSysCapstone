We would and talk as a group for half of class and then the other half we would do activities like dodgeball, basketball, etc. Had one presentation, a paper, \"final\" (online) and then like easy reading assignments. Such an easy A (easy grader) and highly recommend as a GE. Jerry is super entertaining and great!",

Jerry is amazing and super understanding, I would take the class again just for him! However if this class says itll be at the ARC- DO NOT TAKE IT was not worth the extra 1 hr travel time just to go to class",

You basically get to play games and learn about how simple games can change a kids life, while also bonding with your peers. If you go to class and take notes, its easy to pass, just pay attention. Would definitely suggest!",

It is tough to do group projects, but towards the middle of the semester things started to run smooth. There were too many assignments going on in her class for a couple different weeks, so yes there is stress, but would take again.",

These were poorly done as she never actually showed any examples of what each document should look like. Therefore, you have to guess what the assignments should look like finished each week. She's a lenient grader to make up for it though.",

Most classes are somewhat lecture-heavy, and then there is practice time for roleplays. Sue talks about experiences in the social work field, which I found helpful for my future.",
