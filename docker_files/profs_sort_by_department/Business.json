If you go to class, then you probably don't need to study as much as someone who doesn't attend. His tests shouldn't be hard at all if you study the slides. Truly a great professor.",

Mondays were interesting lectures about goal-setting/values/leadership, Wednesday was a team day (you have a team for the semester where you run an online company), and Fridays were exercises in which the class practiced leadership skills. All very fun, all easy",

My advice would be to attend every lecture (I got 10 bonus points just for showing up to 90% of classes), basically memorize his powerpoints (including notes under the slides), and do any extra credit available. Charles cares and is easy on the eyes, but you do need to put work in",

The class is difficult but if you attend class and study you should have no problem.  The simulation is fun and Klinker is very good about helping and giving second chances.  Favorite teacher of college.",

Her lectures skip over at least half of the material she puts on her exams, and doesn't even let you see your old exams to study from. You basically have to teach yourself the class. Really, the entire class is taught by mindtap, not Susan. Also, 75% of your grade is based off the tests!!",

As a student, it's hard to have a professor who did great on teaching, caring students a lot and not hard class. His lecture is very interesting and useful based on his business experience. He will prepare lots of material to help you study for the exams. Take him",

He's a genuine student advocate, always wanting to help and not hinder or punish. Easily made it to my top 3 favorite professors at OSU. Also, his advice on life in general is spot on.",

He has a consistent record of being one of the best subject matter experts in the logistics major at OSU and is well respected by students. His tests go off the PPT slides and basic common sense. No book needed either!",

Easy quizzes, few assignments only take 2-3 hours to complete and exams were simple, especially since he follows the study guide. Highly recommend not only because it's easy but because he is an amazing lecturer with great experience and incredibly helpful.",

Instead of a final there was a final paper, which was easy enough that I finished it within an hour. He might add in another group project but either way the class is well worth it. Fav professor",

Extremely nice teacher who helps anyway he can. Truly wish he had more Logistics courses offered",
