In the half semester course, your grade is composed of weekly quizzes (4 of 6 count) and one final exam. Extra credit given for good performance on quizzes. Extremely nice teacher who helps anyway he can. Truly wish he had more Logistics courses offered",

Didn't give out a curve but put built in extra credit on the exams (ex: the final had 140 total points but was only graded out of 100), so even though the exams were hard, it was pretty easy to get an A on them. The only in-class component is an optional recitation once a week. Overall had a good experience.",

Took my first test, studied hard, knew everything, and got a 62 because she did not teach a lot of the material. Lectures maybe discussed 4 things. Very fast talker and fast paced class. Hard no matter what prof, but she makes it harder. So nice though!",
