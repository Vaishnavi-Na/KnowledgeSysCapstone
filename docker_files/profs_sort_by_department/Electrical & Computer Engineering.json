Students warn against his capstone class due to harsh grading, with low means and maximums on final projects, suggesting overly demanding standards not aligned with student capabilities.

        "comment": "Benjamin is one of the most unenthusiastic profs I've ever had. He emphasizes reading the textbook for the course which is incredibly dense and filled with a lot of irrelevant information. Has awful handwriting and is the only prof who doesn't record his lectures so you can't go back and listen to what he writes. He's a decent guy but a bad teacher",
