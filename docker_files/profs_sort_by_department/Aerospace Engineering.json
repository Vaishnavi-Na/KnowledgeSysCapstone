Seriously, if you have taken linear algebra before, are decent at MATLAB, and do the homework without copying solutions, you should be okay without even paying attention. Homework isn't like the exams in terms of MATLAB, but she gives great hints of what theory is on exams via lectures and homeworks. Make good cheat sheets!",
