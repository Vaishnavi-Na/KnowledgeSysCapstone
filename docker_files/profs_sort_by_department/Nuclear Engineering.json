I just felt like I didn't get much out of it as I liked to learn mostly just conceptual details. If you're interested in Nuclear engineering or maybe a Nuke minor definitely take it. ",

There every step of the way, very approachable, effectively communicated course material. Would definitely recommend him and this course. Great intro into the Nuclear field!",
