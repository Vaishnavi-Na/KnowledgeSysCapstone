Just make sure to read the textbook since some of the material on the exam will not be taught in class, and stay on top of material since there are pop quizzes. Also on the 2 papers and final presentation make sure to follow the rubric. Not the easiest class, but if you put in the work you will do fine.",

Midterms also overly difficult for a basic public speaking class. Allows students to give speeches on their own interests and offers great feedback. Tough attendance policy.",
