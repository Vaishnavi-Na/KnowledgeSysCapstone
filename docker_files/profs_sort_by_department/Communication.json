She's very willing to help and does a great job at providing an open classroom. Kind of a tough grader but nevertheless, a good professor. ",

The book isn't needed and the speeches were explained well in class and very easy. She was extremely helpful with class material and questions about her major or any internship suggestions.",

Have to go to class since it's 5% of your grade. 4 papers are 40% (but they are pretty easy to do) and the rest of the grade is from exams. However, you need to study the slides carefully because he needs to do a better job clarifying certain questions on the exams.",

She had high-expectation for each student so she's definitely a tough grader, but as a student, I feel that it's great to have an instructor that can teach you some real stuff.",

If you show up to lectures and participate, she will teach you what she is expecting from you in terms of assignments. Great class and a great atmosphere to be in when she's teaching. I would definitely any of her other classes again!",
