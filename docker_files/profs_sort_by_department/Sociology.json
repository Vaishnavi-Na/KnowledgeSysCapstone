One 12-15 page research paper, two exams, and a peer review make up the final grade. Reading the textbook is necessary.

Instead of listening to the lectures, I just downloaded the notes and reviewed those.

The chapters of the book are long and boring, and quizes and exams rely a good portion on them. She needs to cut down on the busy work for the class. Far too many small assignments that take a lot of effort for little portions of the grade.",

Exams are 100% essay based, but he gives the questions ahead of time so if you put the time into studying you will get a good grade. He is also very approachable and willing to help you prepare. Quizzes were easy points, the only complaint I have is there was A LOT of reading.",

Fair grader...more than willing to help on essays. I didnt think tests were hard if you had good notes and of course studied! AMAZING! Take her class!",
