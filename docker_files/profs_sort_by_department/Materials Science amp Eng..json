Her classes are impossible to pass and every time I tried to ask for help on assignments, she made herself unavailable. Worst professor at The Ohio State University, by far!! Run away as fast as you can. Save yourself countless headaches and avoid Maryam at ALL costs!!!",

The classes are pointless, mainly consisting of with lecture slides that are 100+ pages long or guest lectures that are only slightly related to the course. The homework doesnt help, the textbook is terrible, and recitations are a waste of time. Example problems are not done in class but make up 70% of the exam.",
