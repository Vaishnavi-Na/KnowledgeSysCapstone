        "comment": "Dr. Sumption's lectures are dry, hard to follow, and not helpful for the course. His slides are screenshots from the textbook, and the book explains the concepts better than him. He's a physicist by training and not a materials scientist and it shows. Read the book and put a lot of time and effort into the final presentation and you'll be fine.",
