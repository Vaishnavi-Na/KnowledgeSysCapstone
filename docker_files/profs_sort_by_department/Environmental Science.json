    "summary_comment": "Professor Davis is known for his extensive and passionate lectures, often filled with interesting stories and scientific details. However, his exams and quizzes are challenging due to the vast amount of information provided, with some students finding the multiple-choice sections particularly tricky. Despite this, all course materials are readily available online, making it possible to study effectively.",

It's all in the powerpoints, but there's WAY too much information for a 15 T/F & 15 MCQ exam! And some MCQ's range from a-h. Very easy to miss questions, no matter how much you study. Not worth it!",

Every lecture is saved in a powerpoint online and easy to access and study from. You can tell he loves science with a passion, although this sometimes causes him to go off on tangents. Overall a good guy and a great class.",

Tests/Quizzes might seem a little tricky, but all of the information is in the powerpoint slides.  It's just A LOT of information.",

He also gives you about 100 terms he wants you to know for the exam. The first couple of quizzes I have taken were fill in the blank. That was a little difficult. Although he is a nice professor.",

He tests on things that he doesn't stress important in the lecture so take thorough notes.  The quizes are also hard so you have to study.  Would not recoomend.",
