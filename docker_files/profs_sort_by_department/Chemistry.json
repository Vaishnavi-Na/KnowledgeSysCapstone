He responds to emails quickly and wants his students to do well in chem and in life. Chem 1210 is a hard class and theres homework every night but Fus makes it doable and inspires you to work hard.

Her lecture slides tend to be short and to the point, she works out many practice problems to make sure you understand the basics but reading the textbook is important to understand the more complicated steps. She uses mastering sparingly.",

Despite these issues, some students appreciate her knowledge and find value in supplementary resources like TAs and online materials.",

Lectures are often difficult to follow due to the use of scripts and profanity, and the professor is generally not helpful during office hours. Students describe mixed experiences, with some finding her excellent for general chemistry but harsh and demoralizing for biochemistry, while others appreciate her kindness outside of class but struggle with her teaching methods.",

If you enjoy chemistry, as long as Dr. Clark teaches 1910H, you should take it over 1210/1610. The course material is interesting and applicable to the real world; it is taught by a personable human being.",

That being said DO NOT miss any classes. Although he uses slides, most of the exam topics come directly from his chalkboard notes. Also, the class offers very few points, so every point matters.",
