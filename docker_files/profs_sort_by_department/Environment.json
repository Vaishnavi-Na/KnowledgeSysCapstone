He was funny at the start of lectures, but if you are not too invested in the material it can be hard to get through lectures. The class is fairly easy. I never had to reach out to him for help.",

The textbook is written and provided by Prof. McCoy in PDF form and is very succinct. Lecture slides were a bit wordy, so be sure to highlight/underline what's important.",

Weekly online quizzes are a huge to your grade and should be taken seriously with a small group project and a final. Can pass without going to class but every now and then.",

It was hard to go to his lectures and pay full attention, especially when the content isn't that most fascinating, at least to me. However, I am not someone in a hard science field and I was able to pass and I missed a few lectures.",

Topics were organized and there was not textbook required but I feel that this class could have been more informative/memorable and exciting with a different teaching style.",

The class can be boring, but he really gives you a solid foundation If you talk to him and ask questions class is great. Recommen",
