He's incredibly passionate about teaching and inspires future welding engineers. If you pay attention and put in the effort, getting a good grade is very doable. Plus, he's always available to explain things after class! ",

You could be laying the hospital with every bone in your body broken and he wont do so much as give you an extension. Aside from that though his courses are well put together and quite informative. He likes to throw pointless curveballs in questions to trip you up.",

His exams are pretty easy though, if you actually understand the material. He loves what he does and teaches it well!",
