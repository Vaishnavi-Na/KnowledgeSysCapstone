    "summary_comment": "Professor Felice effectively teaches the basics of Maya through engaging lectures and tutorials, and emphasizes the importance of active participation in class discussions, though this can be challenging for introverted students. While his approach helps develop essential 3D modeling skills, it also faces criticism for lack of artistic freedom and perceived grading biases.",
    "summary_comment_short": "Professor Felice effectively teaches the basics of Maya through engaging lectures and tutorials, but requires active participation in class discussions to maintain a high grade. His approach can be seen as rigid and unforgiving towards introverted or less participative students, while he is respected for his commitment to skill development and high standards.",

The major downside is that you HAVE to participate in discussions in class, or your grade suffers a lot. He has an option for &quot;quiet learners&quot; where you can email him lecture reflections. Teaches thru tutorials.",

Basically, you're not allowed to be an introvert. Control freak.",
