We worked on a drawing set for a made up plant species the entire semester (and was required to video the drawing process) and read a ton of readings by Robin Evans. However, she was helpful with critiquing the drawings. It just felt like the class dragged on.",

She is very easy to talk to and makes the time to get to know you. She isn't as focused on function, definitely more interested in form. If you want to succeed, come to class prepared and with great graphics.",

The majority of classes consisted of presentations on university services rather than relevant course material, leading to a lack of engagement and interest. Quizzes were often disconnected from the course content, making them difficult and unfairly weighted in the final grade. Despite these issues, the professor's care and ease of obtaining high grades were notable positive aspects.",

While he may not appear passionate about the material, he is highly supportive and helpful when students engage with him. His grading is relatively lenient, primarily based on participation and a final project, which can be completed with minimal in-class attention. Overall, his teaching quality is strong, though his enthusiasm for the subject matter is less evident.",

He's so nice, and seriously cares so much for his students, his feedback is great, and is willing to give lots of help to whoever asks for it. My only advice is to be at every single class, and ALWAYS have your project finished. I only saw him get upset when kids didn't finish assignments/skipped class",

He will definitely leave you well prepared for future studio classes! However, this class (no matter the professor) is a TONNNN of work!! Don't take if you don't have to. Not a good 'just for fun' elective.",
