Be prepared to budget $40 per assignment as a bare minimum, because he will insist on you going and getting different materials every time you come to class.

He contradicts himself, he insults students,and his rubrics feel like they depend on the phase of the moon and whether mercury is in retrograde or not. he's extremely condescending and inconsiderate.

It was easier to stay confused than ask for help, because he just made things more confusing. He grades easy though, which is surprising given his high level of difficulty. If you're not an artist, dont take this class! SAVE YOURSELF!!!",

If the ideas and concepts in your piece don't match with his, or you don't follow what he has in mind exactly, your grade will suffer.
