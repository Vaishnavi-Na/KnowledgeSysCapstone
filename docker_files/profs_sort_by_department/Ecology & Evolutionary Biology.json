    "summary_comment": "The professor offers an easy class with minimal homework (only two papers and two presentations), though some find the workload excessive for a three-credit-hour course. Students appreciate the interesting guest speakers and the teacher's interest in the subject matter, though feedback varies regarding the teacher's responsiveness and the group work requirement. Overall, opinions are mixed, with some strongly recommending it as a writing class and others finding it overly demanding.",
