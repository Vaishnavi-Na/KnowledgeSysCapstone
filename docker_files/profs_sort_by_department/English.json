She also loves to degrade you in front of the class. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS SHE IS TERRIBLE!",

Usually it was just because they couldn't get into the material, but those people weren't good with English anyways, right&#63;  Simmons loves to help people, always has good insight when you ask for help, and had plenty of unusual, cool information on all sorts of things.

There are pop quizzes but super easy if you do the reading. Sometimes his interpretations of books were mind blowing. He can be a tough grader, but theres always bonus questions.",

Baker is the type of teacher that likes for people to talk and be active (u do a lot of group work). other than that, its a class that is managable for 3 months of a quarter",
