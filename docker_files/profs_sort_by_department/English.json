I will say that he does talk in circles and covers little content in a long lecture, but I learned a lot nonetheless and didn't have to do a lot of work. Also you can't really skip the films."

We never had any homework other than just having to write our final paper which we submitted in parts. He is so caring and generous and truly took so much stress off my back. He kept telling me not to stress that we are all new to this. So recommend.",
