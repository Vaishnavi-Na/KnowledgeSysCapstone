Homework will NOT help your grade and doing poorly on a test will bump you down multiple letter grades, I went from a high A, to a D- after one test. I would try a different teacher. 2/10 would not take again.",

The exam questions were taken directly from the power points, so as long as you studied at least a little bit, the tests weren't that difficult. I would definitely recommend taking her class.",
