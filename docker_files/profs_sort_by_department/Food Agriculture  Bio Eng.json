She is known for being a fair grader and offering flexible grading options, including open-note exams and optional finals. While some find her lectures lengthy and unclear at times, many appreciate her willingness to provide thorough explanations when questions arise.",

She is extremely caring and will do whatever she can to help you. Her class was a little dry but it was fluid mechanics so I can't blame her for that. She's not an easy A, but if you put the time in, you'll get a good grade",

She was a very fair grader, and gave a decent amount of grade wiggle room, with easily graded group projects. All exams were open note, and the final was optional. Make sure to take good notes.",

The lectures were often long, which was partially because of all of the presentations. It's hard to sit through presentations, when you don't like the projects. Hopefully, this will change for the upcoming fall.",
