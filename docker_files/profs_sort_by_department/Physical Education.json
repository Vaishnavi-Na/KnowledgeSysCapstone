While some students found value in the content and appreciated her teaching style, others struggled with the workload and found the material pseudo-scientific or repetitive. Overall, her yoga courses emphasize attendance and personal reflection but can be challenging and demanding.",

If you want a class where the guy teaching it takes grading WAY too seriously, take this class.  It's sport for the spectator...what a joke.  If you are lucky he will post the notes up 6Hrs before class, and the grades 2wks after.",
