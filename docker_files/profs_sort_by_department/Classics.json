He makes class enjoyable to the point that I looked forward to going to lecture. Coming into the class with no knowledge about that subject matter what-so-ever, I had no problem getting an A. And it helped that he was gorgeous!",

Besides that obvious reason to take the class, it is extremely easy, you don't even have to do the readings, he tells you everything you need to know for the tests and quizzes. The class is so laidback and entertaining I don't even mind going and the class is taught exactly how a GEC should be.",

Go to lecture and recitation (if you have a good TA like Sam Flores), read the Spark/Cliff Notes, and you'll likely get an A if you have a decent memory.
