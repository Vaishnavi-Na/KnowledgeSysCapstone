And her slides are virtually useless to help with studying. Other than that her class is very easy as long as you keep up with the readings and do your study guides that she provides, its an easy A.",

People say that if you read you will do good, well i bought the books and did not read at all and got an A. Dont waste your money. Just attend class and take notes and its an easy A.",
