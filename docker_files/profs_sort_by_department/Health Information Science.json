Content was so hard and only thing he did was record himself reading the lecture slides. Only grades are exams and many questions are not covered in the textbook or lecture. Nice guy but DO NOT TAKE HIM",

There are only 3 grades for 3 tests so your final grade depends on your performance, but if you attend class, review lecture slides, and study, it's super easy.
