She truly creates an environment where you can feel comfortable interacting with her and other students. A very worthwhile GEC.",

Took the time to confront the obnoxious pack of girls chattering at the back of a packed lecture hall, much to mine (and everyone else's) delight. In a GEC class of 70, no easy feat.",
