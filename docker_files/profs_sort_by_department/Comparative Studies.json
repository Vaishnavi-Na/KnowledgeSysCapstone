He makes each lecture interactive and interesting. Not even a comp studies major but got valuable information"

        "comment": "Professor Cobb is really easy-going and relatable. The weekly readings can be a bit of a pain and she sometimes posts next week's readings really late, which can be inconvenient. She encourages critical thinking and discussions during her lessons. This course gets kind of heavy towards the end since there's a paper and also a group project due.",

        "comment": "Emma is amazing and understanding. She is always willing to help her students. This course was very content heavy at the end. Every week we had two (easy) discussion posts and at the end we had a huge group project and final paper. If you follow instructions, it will be easy. Don't let group members slack off because your grade will suffer too.",

With having COVID and struggling to meet deadlines because of life, he met me halfway and didn't penalize/scold me. A great professor and interesting course material! Most of grade is determined by group presentations on films as well as your own research.",

The pop quizzes in recitation are ridiculously specific even if you go to lecture a lot of people in my class struggle which is dumb because that assignment is meant to gage your attendance. Finally the class makes a lot of conclusions based on feeling not fact",

Armstrong is very passionate about the subject and shows interesting films and documentaries though the readings are generally very boring and hard to get through.",
