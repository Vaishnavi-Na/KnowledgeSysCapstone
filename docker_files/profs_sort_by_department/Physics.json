I spent a lot of time on the lectures and homework because it would get confusing sometimes. it took her MONTHS to grade everything. the exams were a lot harder than the material covered in class, and you couldn't go back to answer past questions which sucked. don't recommend.",

Students appreciate his structured approach and the high correlation between practice exams and actual assessments, though some find his policies and workload demanding. Overall, while his lectures can be dry, his clear focus on helping students excel is evident.",

    "summary_comment": "Professor Walker is widely regarded as ineffective and disorganized, with many students finding his lectures unhelpful and focusing more on self-study. While some appreciate his humor, his frequent tangents and lack of focus on core physics concepts make his classes a significant challenge. Students generally advise seeking out alternative resources or professors for a more structured learning experience.",
