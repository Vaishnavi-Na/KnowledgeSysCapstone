    "summary_comment": "The professor is generally regarded as an ineffective lecturer, often overshadowed by student noise during lectures and struggling to convey information clearly. While the course material itself is not particularly challenging, the reliance on Tophat for both learning and assessment\u2014combined with difficult midterms and poor exam performance\u2014makes the class demanding. Some students find him approachable outside of class, but his teaching methods are widely criticized for their inefficiency.",

Last midterm, the class average was a 73% with the highest grade being a 79%--still no curve. Good professor, but makes the class hard to succeed in.",

So you basically have to be perfect to get an A but the questions are basically the same as the HW or examples. I think this is a much easier A the other sections of the class.",

There are three exams but two count towards 90% of your grade. 10% is homework and quizzes which are graded for completion not accuracy. Very hard to pay attention but overall not bad.",

Hes funny &amp; nice but Dr. Olimov way of teaching is a little overwhelming, but just follow his way of solving psets.

He is impossible to work with, unorganized, didn't use Carmen, and one of the worst professors I've ever had. I hope they get some new professors to teach his material because he was the only prof available for this class.",

His tests are rather easy - if you do the homeworks and quizzes, you should have no problem getting an A on the tests.  In 4 years at OSU, he's one of the best teachers I've had.",

        "comment": "Difficult class for me at beginning as an international student, his spanish accent and usage of ppt distracted my attention. My first midterm sucked. But, he changed his method, choosing to use blackboard. I found that was very helpful. Grade is curved. So don't worry about that. It's his first term at osu and he is a phD from Northwestern.",

Tests are somewhat difficult, so make sure to study. Gives enough extra credit assignments to make it easy to get a good grade if you try. Not a fun class, but manageable.",
