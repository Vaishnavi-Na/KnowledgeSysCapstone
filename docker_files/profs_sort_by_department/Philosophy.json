My only warning is to prep well for the final. He made it sound like it wouldn't be very hard during class, so I didn't study very much, but when we actually got it I felt a little unprepared."

        "comment": "Piers is great at making Philosophy interesting and engaging, and often crafts his lectures around group conversation and participation. The only downside is that it can feel disorganized and like its on you to figure out what to study, rather than any clear criteria. If you show up to class and read the material, you should be just fine!",

He's upfront about his grading process, but did not seem to have time to grade papers as they were sent in. He made me challenge what I thought I knew on topics discussed. Great class &amp; material, jumbled prof!",
