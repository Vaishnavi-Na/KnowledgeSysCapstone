While some appreciate her prompt responses to emails and fair grading on papers, the overall consensus is that the course is unnecessarily difficult and not worth the effort for a General Education requirement.

They provide clear assignments and guidelines, ensuring students understand what is expected. Mandatory attendance is strictly enforced but does not detract from the positive learning environment. The class incorporates various interactive elements such as discussions, videos, and activities, enhancing the educational experience. Students consistently praise it as one of the best classes they have taken.",

Attendance is mandatory, but not a class that you would dread going to. Lots of class discussions, videos, and activities. Overall, really great experience and one of the best classes I have taken!",
