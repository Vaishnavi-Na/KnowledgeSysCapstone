    "summary_comment": "Based on student feedback, Professor Kevin Freeman is perceived as having poor teaching quality and ineffective advising. Students found his lectures irrelevant and overly focused on personal anecdotes, leading to a largely unproductive learning experience. Many also noted his unhelpful and discouraging demeanor during advising sessions, describing his approach as inefficient and counterproductive.",

He was 15 minutes late and then trashed me the entire time telling me I would not make it in any law school. I just made it into law school with a huge scholarship and have talked to others that were discouraged by Mr. Freeman. Should never be an advisor.",

Really hard person to get along with overall. Stay away.",
