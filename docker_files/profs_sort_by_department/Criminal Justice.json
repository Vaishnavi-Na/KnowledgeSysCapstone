He was 15 minutes late and then trashed me the entire time telling me I would not make it in any law school. I just made it into law school with a huge scholarship and have talked to others that were discouraged by Mr. Freeman. Should never be an advisor.",

Really hard person to get along with overall. Stay away.",
