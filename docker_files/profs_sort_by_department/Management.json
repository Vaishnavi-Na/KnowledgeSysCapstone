An A- is absolutely doable but hardly anyone gets As and I wish I had known that. The course only has 4 grades, one which is 40% and he grades harshly. Great class, just be prepared that an A is difficult.",

I'd say you'll have about one to two hours of work per week for this class which is very manageable. Read the chapters and study his slides before his tests and you'll be fine! Take him",

Exams were relatively easy, but somehow 50 multiple choice questions equates to 600 points. He gives a lot of EC and the online hw and quizzes you should get 100% on easily.",

Do the assignments and show up for the exams. You will get an easy A. His lectures aren't necessary its better to just read.",

Exams are about 75% of your grade, and they are pretty difficult (Midterm and Final). The other 25% is weekly assignments, which are pretty much participation points. Definitely the easiest business core class.",
