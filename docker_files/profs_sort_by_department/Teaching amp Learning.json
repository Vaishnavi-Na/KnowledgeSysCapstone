There is reading to do every week but it was never long or difficult to understand. He also incorporated a lot of group work during class so he isn't just a sit and listen to me talk type of professor. Take his class if you can!",

You're just reading picture books and children's books and discussing what you learned from that week in a page-long summary, book report, or other assignment.

The 3 papers were on 3 different books, and you are expected to read a book a week for discussion. If you read them, the class discussions are very interesting and informative. A wonderful instructor.",
