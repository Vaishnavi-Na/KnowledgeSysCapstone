I emailed him multiple times and he never got back to me. He promised to let class out early each session and he only did that a few times which was annoying. Avoid him at all costs!",

While not every assignment was 100 percent clear &amp; objective, much of the work was dictated by the student needs and wants. 10/10.",

Super repetitive, and kind of boring. this class specifically was mainly all about reading research papers, which isnt terrible but then in his lectures thats what he talks about instead of actually teaching the material in his own words. Grade is only quizzes and they are worded terribly and are super confusing!!",
