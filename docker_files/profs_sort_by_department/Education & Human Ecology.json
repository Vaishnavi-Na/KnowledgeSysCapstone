While some find his exams open-note and relatively straightforward, others describe the class as tedious and overwhelming due to the significant amount of reading and writing required. Students generally acknowledge his approachability but suggest finding an alternative instructor if possible.",

While he is described as a relatively approachable and nice professor, many students prefer to take the class with a different instructor due to the heavy workload and the perceived lack of engagement in his lectures.",

His lectures are pretty boring, and you are expected to read a lot. He's really nice, but take this class with a different professor if you can.",

There are weekly quizzes and PPTs about the dimensions of wellness that can be interesting if you pay attention, but you can take the quiz without that. Took me about 30 min/week for an A",
